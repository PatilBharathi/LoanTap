Recommendations

2. NPA (non-performing asset) is a real problem, it’s important we play safe and shouldn’t disburse loans to anyone and at the same time Focus to get more intrest on giving loans.
3.

4. pay the loan completely or charged.
5. We may wish to work on calculating more reasonable interest rates and new intrest metrics what so ever. We have to be rationale on why we are keeping interest rate high? as loans with high interest rates are more likely to be unplaid.
